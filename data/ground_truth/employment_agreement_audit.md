## Notes

_Additional observations for lessons learned_

- Non-compete is almost certainly unenforceable in California
- Named competitor list (Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Salesforce, Oracle, SAP) is exceptionally broad
- "Cause" definition at 12.3(f) "any other reason the Company determines" makes at-will effectively meaningless
- Prior Invention EXCLUSIVE license is unusual - typically non-exclusive
