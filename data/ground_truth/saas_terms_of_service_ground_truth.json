  "_annotation_notes": "This SaaS agreement is heavily provider-favorable with: no refunds, no service credits, 3-month liability cap, no data breach liability, broad data usage rights, unilateral modification rights, and auto-renewal traps. The combination of no SLA remedies plus no liability for data loss puts significant risk on the Customer. Company can essentially terminate, change terms, or remove features at will with minimal recourse for Customer."
